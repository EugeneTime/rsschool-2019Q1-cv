## SUMMARY

**Helping others**. I like to help others to understand the learning material. I understand the benefits of teamwork. Almost from the very beginning of the course, I became an RS Activist at the RS School. At the moment, I make notes with educational material for students of RS School.

**Systematization of information**. I like to systematize large amounts of information and transform it to the form convenient for learning. I create notes, where the educational material is presented in a very simple language. This approach helps me and other RS School students to assimilate information better.

**I like computers, web-technologies and programming**. A year after I got my first computer at about 13 years old, I started helping friends, friends of friends, etc with PC diagnostics. :) In 2009 I created my first website. It became popular, and for a long time I was involved in administration and SEO promotion of sites. Now I am interested in many web technologies, and I would like to become a Junior web developer.

**Teamwork experience**. In 2009, I organized a team of volunteers who worked on a multimedia site. I have also organized non-profit teams in my city twice. The last time was in 2018, and it was a team of people who wanted to improve their English. Native speakers were also invited to help with learning. The goal was to have regular communication in English.

**I like to learn new things**. I understand that my knowledge and skills are far from perfect. That is why I am ready to devote a lot of time to learning and practicing my skills. At the moment, I am improving my skills in adaptive web design, and trying to understand JS coding better.
